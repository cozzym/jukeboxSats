# Project Docs

This folder contains living documentation for the caf√© music seed idea.

- PRD: product requirements and acceptance criteria
- Brainstorm: dated session notes we append as we go
- ADRs: Architecture/Decision Records for durable choices

Suggested workflow:
- Capture ideas in `brainstorm/` (one file per session, date-stamped)
- Promote decisions into `adr/` (immutable records with status)
- Keep the authoritative MVP scope in `prd/seed-prd.md`
